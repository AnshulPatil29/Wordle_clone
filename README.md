# Wordle_clone
### A wordle clone created using JS,CSS and HTML
#### Setup
Download the Wordle folder. Edit the paths for stylesheet and script in index.html if needed. A live server is required to run the code since it imports realDictionary from dictionary.js into index.js. I used the live server extension on VScode.
If using vscode, right click on index.html and click run with live server. It should launch the site on the default browser of the system.
#### Note
This is my first project using the JS,CSS and HTML, which is why I am positive the code can be improved vastly. Referenced multiple tutorials for making wordle clones but implemented the word matching logic and animations by myself.
#### Future implementations
The qwerty layout of buttons can be added as seen on the actual site but I don't plant on implementing it. I do plan on implementing a hint feature which allows the player to get 1 green letter revealed in exchange for 1 of the remaining tries, and this can be done only once.
