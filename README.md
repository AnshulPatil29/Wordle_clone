# Wordle_clone
### A wordle clone created using JS,CSS and HTML
#### Setup
Download the Wordle folder. Edit the paths for stylesheet and script in index.html if needed. A live server is required to run the code since it imports realDictionary from dictionary.js into index.js. I used the live server extension on VScode.
#### Note
This is my first project using the JS,CSS and HTML, which is why I am positive the code can be improved vastly. Referenced multiple tutorials for making wordle clones but implemented the word matching logic and animations by myself.
